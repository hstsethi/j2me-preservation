The SDK features support for
- A Macromedia Flash Lite 2.1 player. 
- A TCP/IP protocol stack. 
- Various Diagnostics features including on/off on-the-fly tracing,
  a network traffic monitor and a MIDP memory monitor.

The SDK replicates the UI of the Nokia 6267 handset, including the
general look, key layout, key definitions, error messages, display and
rendering, soft keys, and menu selection. The Nokia 6267 device has 
keys on both sides that are made available to the user by emphasizing 
them in the GUI.

The SDK is shipped with Dutch, English, French, German, Italian,
Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish language support as standard. To add 
additional language support, you may install the World Languages 
pack from the same web site from which you installed the SDK.

The SDK allows MIDP tracing of many Java events. You can enable tracing 
by using the SDK menu selection: Tools/Preferences/MIDP Monitor. 
To capture the tracing information to a file, use the SDK command line 
interface to start the SDK. For example:
C:\Nokia\Devices\S40_5th_Edition_SDK\bin> emulator -Xnew >>tracelog.txt


Tested IDEs:
===============
- Eclipse 3.2.2 with EclipseME 1.6.6 or higher
- Sun NetBeans 5.5 with Mobility Pack 5.5
- Nokia Mobile Internet Toolkit (NMIT) 4.1 with patch for JRE 5
- Adobe GoLive CS2
- MacroMedia Dreamweaver 8


System Requirements:
====================

Supported Platforms:
- Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP2
- Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP2 Chinese
- Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition SP2

Additional requirement:
- Java Runtime Environment 5 or later
  (JRE 1.5 was used during the testing of this product)
- Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.5 or higher

Minimum hardware requirements:
- Pentium-class computer with 667 MHz or faster CPU
  256 MB RAM , 16-bit color, 1024x768 resolution
  100MB of hard disk space
  Network interface card

Recommended hardware configuration:
- Pentium-class computer with 2.8 GHz or faster CPU
  512 MB RAM , 24-bit color, 1024x768 resolution
  140MB of hard disk space
  Sound card
  Network interface card

JSR177 developers need a smart card reader. Gemplus reader
was used for testing.


Disclaimer:
===========
- While the SDK contains the actual handset software functionality
  is not identical due to simulations and differences in the
  hardware. It is recommended to do final tests on actual handsets.

- The PC rendering of colors in the SDK may not match colors seen on
  the actual handset. However, the SDK is ideal for verifying pixel
  location and the general appearance of the handset UI.

- Sound simulation in the SDK does not accurately represent the handset.
  This SDK is not recommended as a primary tool for development of sound.
  However, it is ideal for verifying sound as part of application
  testing.


Compatibility Issues:
=====================
- The SDK may not work well with some sound card/driver combinations. 
  In such cases, sound may be inaudible and MIDlets that use MMAPI
  may fail. As a workaround try replacing the driver for the sound card.

General Information:
====================
When using Java ME traces from the command line in tandem with the 
instance reuse feature, traces that are implemented on a per-run time 
basis are cumulative. For example, one run-time you choose to run 
'emulator.exe –Xverbose:gc c:\mymidlet.jad', the midlet will be executed  
in the running SDK instance with garbage collection traces turned on. 
Running a second time, 'emulator.exe –Xverbose:class c:\mymidlet.jad', 
will cause your midlet to load and run in the running instance with 
both gc and class traces turned on. You can turn the traces off in the 
SDK preferences GUI. Alternatively, you can restart the SDK. 

If you use an upper case letter in the name of a Java MIDlet RMS file, 
you will see that the name of the RMS file duplicated on your PC contains 
a box in place of that character. This accurately duplicates the internal 
file name coding of the handset. 

Known Problems and Limitations:
===============================

1)The SDK supports T=0 smart card communication in JSR 177 SATSA-APDU.

2)API (JSR 135) method GetKeyValue can be applied only on 3gpp, mp4, mp3 
and 3gpp2 format.

3)RTSP streaming in Mobile Media API (JSR 135) is not functional in 
the SDK as a consequence one TCK case was excluded from JSR 135. This 
issue will be corrected in the next SDK. You may use rtsp:// schema
in URLs but the connection will not be completed.
Seek and Skip are not functional in the SDK for video content types.
Workaround: After writing the MIDLets using this API the user can test
using the phone. Seek and Skip for video recording are not supported
in the SDK.

4)MP3 audio streaming embedded in FLashlite files will not be played
in SDK, but plays fine on Phone.
Issue: MP3 audio streaming embedded in FLashlite files is not
supported in SDK.
Workaround: Test using the phone for this media content for Flaslite,
as the phone fully supports MP3 audio for Flashlite.

5)The handset supports DRM2.0 but the SDK is limited to DRM1.0.

6)The video playback has limitations. It does not play sound. Video recording
is limited to taking snapshot.
Blank screen may appear when changed to Full screen depending the video file size.
Need to press navigation keys to start the video playback.
Issue: Blank screen may appear when changed to Full screen
depending the video file size.
Workaround: Need to press navigation keys to start the video playback

7) Korean and Japanese languages are not supported in SDK as part of FL
localized features.
No workaround Phone doesn't provide the language support.
No use for the use developing and testing these languages.

8) SDK package size is 46.8MB.
This makes user to take more time to download the SDK from FN.
Hence workaround is not required as this doesn't limits the user,
but need to wait for more time comparatively.
